# Contributing

This module was designed for use in education; particularly for young children.
It is not intended to replace `RPi.GPIO` and it does not claim to be suitable
for all purposes. It is intended to provide a simple interface to everyday
components.

If a proposed change added an advanced feature but made basic usage more
complex, it is unlikely to be added.

Unlike gpiozero, if a feature is considered as giving too much hand-holding, it will be withdrawn :)
